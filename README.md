  A tribute to Bruce Willis
</h1>
<h2>Celebrating one of Hollywood's Greatest Movie Stars</h2>
<p>This application was build as a tribute to one of my favorite actors: Bruce Willis.

I also made this project to start learning TypeScript. Furthermore I have had limited experience with styled-components and working with REST-API's so this was great to be able to implement this also!

Page-speed optimization has been a focus of this project. Check out PageSpeed insights to test the performance of Bruce-willis.rocks:

<p>I have used the power of Gatsby.js and server-side rendering along with concepts like React Lazy to make a fast page with great speed scores. But there are also a lot of small *tricks* I have used like preconnecting to the REST API url in the header, preloading the portrait image of Bruce Willis used on the mainpage, and using Preact instead of React in production.</p>
